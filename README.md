# Emojify
A model built using LSTM's and word vector representations to predict an emoji for a given input sentence.
For example when user inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!"), then model finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (⚾️).
pre-trained 50-dimensional GloVe embeddings from kaggle were used for building this model.
